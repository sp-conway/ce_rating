1,40,Black or African-American,No,Male,I chose based on my own preferences for features of devices. I placed more weight on certain features over others.
54,24,Other,Yes,Female,I chose something in the middle of the margin
55,32,Asian,No,Male,I chose the performance and balance it with cost. 
56,29,White,No,Female,I followed the task instruction and also paid attention.
57,33,White,No,Male,I went with the highest average between the two numbers for each specific item.
58,27,"Asian,Other",Yes,Male,Whichever is more appealing in terms of performance and also not too low of a warranty
59,48,White,No,Male,The pricing task was mostly decided on the weight i attached to the attributes of each product and how much gap is between the product in the most important attribute. THe second task was decided mostly the same way too.
60,33,White,No,Female,"I didn't have a specific process, I just chose what felt right"
5,54,White,No,Male,INTERSTING SURVEY
61,30,White,No,Female,NA
65,29,White,No,Female," I aimed to assign prices based on the relative quality of each attribute. Higher values in these categories typically correspond to higher prices, assuming that better specifications lead to more desirable products. For example, products with better memory, faster processing speed, or higher energy savings would generally be priced higher."
66,41,White,No,Male,"I compared the energy savings, warranty, and speed based on the items presented to me."
67,52,Black or African-American,No,Male,Just a guess on how much each item is worth.
68,30,Asian,No,Male,try to put price under big prices using 9
70,36,Other,Yes,Male,"I weighed my need/wants but many cases where the secondary traits outweighed them due to the low variance between the options. I preferred Processor speed over RAM in most cases, energy was sometimes a big factor for money saving in the long run,  Cooking power was the biggest deciding factor for the microwave ovens. Screen size outweighed the lifespan by a lot, since TV's are so cheap, and the advancement of their technology usually urges to upgrade -probably- before they give out.  "
71,34,White,No,Female,"The choces i made are based on the best performance, highest warranty or highest lifespan  of the product. For example, when making a choice on the best washing machine, I Choose the product that maximizes on energy saving while also providing a higher perfomance power.  When making a choice on the best microwave, I consider one that ha the highest lifespan while also having the highest power output. Price is also a determining factor in making a choice- I choose one that guarantee high profits while also making sure the customer will enjoy the value of their money."
72,41,White,No,Female,Fill in according to data
73,32,White,No,Female,considering the products lifespan and quality
74,22,White,No,Female,in any way
75,55,Asian,No,Male,I always preferred products that will last longer to others  
76,21,Black or African-American,No,Male,I took the categories such as warranty and life-time usage less into consideration because people look more for efficiency and performance rather than longevity
77,47,White,No,Male,I chose my selections based on the value of my personal prefrences. 
78,27,White,No,Male,In the first part my strategy was to price the products as fairly as possible based on my current knowledge of those products. In the 2nd part my strategy was simply to choose what I thought was the best. 
79,63,Black or African-American,No,Male,the strategy at the one with the best life span and the energy saving
80,35,Black or African-American,No,Male,I was careful and patient with the study
81,56,White,No,Male,"In this task, I was item with the highest ratings combined."
82,29,White,Yes,Female,i didnt care much for the warranty more so the function 
83,31,White,No,Male,I chose the one with the best features I valued most.
84,39,Black or African-American,No,Female,"Depending on how I use the item I choose based on my needs. For example, I like to have a larger tv so I choose larger screen sizes with as long a lifespan as possible. A more necessary purchase like a washer machine/dryer needs to have a long lifespan and save energy because it is used a lot. "
85,59,White,No,Female,I considered balance in every aspect
86,38,White,No,Female,"life span, efficiencey "
87,42,White,No,Male, chose what is 
89,30,Black or African-American,No,Female,you need to the speed and ram and the screen size and 
90,47,White,No,Female,"the pricing task was a lot harder.    Without looking up typical market value or knowing where the products would be sold, it is difficult to arrive at a fair price.   For choosing which products to buy, I chose the stats that I placed higher value on and tried to get the best products for the stat I had chosen that also had a decent secondary stat as well.   In most cases, I went by my chosen primary stat but there were a few situations where I chose a balanced product over an unbalanced one, even if the secondary stat was slightly higher. "
91,45,White,No,Male,went for more powerful microwaves regardless of energy saver tried to balance size and lifespan on tv and ram and processing on computers
92,26,Black or African-American,Yes,Female,I made my selection based on prioroty and and how much i feel was sufficient enough
94,20,White,No,Male,cause of the  warranty
6,55,Black or African-American,No,Female,I chose based on the stats of the items that were given. Ex. I tried to choose the most RAM for the laptop or the longest warranty.
96,36,Black or African-American,No,Female,high figures
97,58,White,No,Male,The value that gives me more utility comes first.
99,35,White,No,Male,I prefer higher quality more expensive items that last longer
101,21,"Asian,Black or African-American,White",Yes,Male,I generally did not care about things like warranty or energy savings for certain products I only cared about the particular quality. For the laptop and TV I tried to find the best balance between the stats.
102,43,Black or African-American,No,Male,I try as much possible to rate the functions and assigned what I deemed its worth
104,54,White,No,Male,I decided to go by the one that was most efficient
105,30,Other,Yes,Male,I looked for the best product with the best lifespan or warranty
106,32,White,No,Female,I based everything off a ration of what the warranty/lifespan was to performance to make my assessment. 
107,56,White,No,Female,"I favored the products that had the features I valued more.  With the computers, I valued memory.  Warranty did not matter to me at all.  With washing machines, I like energy efficient but also want a reliable washing machine, so I had to balance those needs.  "
108,49,White,No,Female,"While completing this task, I focused more on the most important aspect of the products displayed "
109,40,White,No,Male,my strategy was to sell items with higher efficiency for higher price and vice verse and to also select items with higher efficiency
110,39,White,No,Female,Based on memory and lifespan i considered the product durable
111,29,White,No,Female,Choosing the best quality items
112,37,White,Yes,Male,"I just tried to choose right, that was the best option for the value for each trial"
114,34,Black or African-American,No,Female,am choosing the best description 
115,43,White,No,Female,I tried to find the best possible product with the highest rating in accordance to what I thought was most important.
116,46,White,No,Female,pick the best rating 
117,58,White,No,Female,"I made different choices depending on the item and if it was average lifespan etc., whichever was more important to me."
118,52,White,No,Female,Processing speed for computers is my most important.  I then looked for the biggest warranty I could get for the speed.  Microwave cooking power mattered.  Dont care as much about warranty on this item.  washing machine life is number one.  I picked the highest saving energy with the longest life of product.
119,26,White,No,Female,I tried to ballpark around the same prices but only go up or down based on how high or low the numbers were
120,31,White,No,Female,I based my prices with the rate on a scale of 1-100
121,33,White,No,Male,Reliability played a major factor when it came to washing machines becuase I factored in the hassle of moving and installation. Small appliances I was more forgiving regarding reliability and wanted some decent performance as well. 
122,38,Black or African-American,No,Non-binary,NA
124,41,White,No,Male,I decided on which feature was most important and weighted my selections based on that factor. 
125,65,White,No,Female,well i tried to use my little knowledge about the importance of each item value  that was clearly stated out and provided to make my decisions by calculations and information's given on them via their importance 
126,46,White,No,Female,I thought about what things customers find most important and I think that is usually performance first.
127,28,White,No,Prefer not to say,I chose higher processing ove life span 
128,39,Asian,Yes,Female,Which ever had the highest number of what I deemed important in the product.
2,34,White,No,Male,I just went with gut feeling and tried to be consistent even though I'm pretty sure I wasn't. I have no idea how much these things actually cost.
8,29,White,No,Female,it was awesome
129,45,White,No,Female,i tried to choose my answers as quickly as possible based on the percentages displayed
130,21,White,No,Male,"it actually depends on the item. if it was a PC i prioritize the processsing speed, while if it was a TV the screen would be priority. On the general I would add the numbers and pick the one with the highest average."
132,39,White,No,Male,give price rangers
133,34,White,No,Male,I priorities some qualities more than another 
134,25,Black or African-American,No,Male,I chose the objectively better products
135,43,Black or African-American,No,Male,"I looked at my priorities like processor power against the ram in the laptop for instance,also things like cooking power and lifespan"
136,38,White,No,Female,"I tried to pick about the average price; I actually resell antiques in real life... I hope I didn't do too bad; I had always been told you don't want to be the lowest because people will think there's something wrong with the product and you don't want to be the highest, because then people will think you're greedy."
137,59,White,No,Female,I choses the product considering long lifespan and best performance 
10,42,White,Yes,Female,I just guessed honestly
11,40,Black or African-American,No,Female,i had to think and analyze well
12,45,White,No,Female,I chose one that was the best of both if one didn't far exceed the others
13,31,Black or African-American,No,Male,NA
14,22,White,No,Male,I took the average number of quality from both options and chose the one with a higher average.
15,40,White,Yes,Female,"I tried to price items according to the features and longevity. And then to choose products, I picked what I perceived to be the best one."
16,37,White,No,Female,"I assumed that immediate benefits are more important to contemporary consumers, so I chose largest screen size, highest cooking power, and energy savings first, then chose best option of the secondary categories."
18,28,Black or African-American,No,Male,"I didn't care about energy savings, as I've only ever lived in apartments. I rated processing speed as worth more than RAM as it takes more labor to find newer CPU chipsets than to slap more RAM into a computer. I have literally never redeemed a warranty in my life and didn't rate it nearly as highly as cooking power. I hope this all helps you understand my answers, or at leasts makes them seem more consistent, which I tried my hardest to be."
4,32,White,No,Female,The study was smoothly on the task following the instructions provided on the start
19,51,Black or African-American,No,Male,"The second part was somehow easy, chosing what I would go for. I imagined I was shopping for the items in an online store and made my preferences."
20,30,White,No,Male,I CHOOSE MY OPTION BECAUSE OF HOW BENEFICIAL IT WILL BE 
23,27,Black or African-American,No,Female,I do my calculations
25,NA,White,No,Female,in laptops i usually looked at processing speed first  and the storage 
26,32,White,No,Female,Engaging
27,35,Black or African-American,No,Female,"Weighed both the RAM and warranty, the highest among each one I chose"
28,62,Black or African-American,No,Male,"I approached this task by evaluating both key attributes, cooking power and warranty, to find the product offering the best overall value. While Products A and B had the highest cooking power, their warranties were relatively low. Product C, on the other hand, maintained strong cooking performance (90) and had the highest warranty (40) among the three. I prioritized long-term reliability and performance balance, as a slightly lower cooking power with better warranty offers more value and customer satisfaction over time."
30,68,White,No,Female,"I can add more memory, so processing speed was more important"
32,45,Black or African-American,No,Female,I chose the better life span on most of them. Some I chose the better warranty. 
33,48,White,No,Male,i chose the product that best suited my needs
34,54,"Asian,White",No,Female,"I tried to look at an average, something in the middle."
35,35,Black or African-American,No,Female,with the pricing I used the numbers that would give me profit but not too high people would not buy. I brought what I was willing to buy with my own money in the second part.
36,42,White,No,Female,I considered the life span of the product
37,26,White,No,Female,"tried to pick oput the products that would have been the best deal, like best warranty and best product specs"
38,29,White,No,Male,power over size
39,21,Black or African-American,No,Female,I check the one with the highest spec in the two categories.
40,50,White,No,Female,i look at what will serve me the longest in the best way possible
41,45,White,No,Male,I WAS PRICING ACCORDING TO THE BEST QUALITY OF A PRODUCT AND CHOOSING PRODUTS WITH THE BEST QUALITY
42,29,Black or African-American,No,Male,I went for the trials with higher rating then the low
43,41,White,No,Female,I thought about how much I would spend on the products for their quality. 
44,24,Asian,No,Female,"For the first phase I would add up the numbers and determine the prices relative to each other based on that. For the second phase, I would pick whatever had the highest numbers in both categories, or whatever had the highest number in the category that I cared about, but if the other number was too low, then I would try to pick one that was not too low on both sides."
45,39,White,No,Female,I chose to focus more of the which product had the higher number for the specifications not related to the warranty as I believe that is secondary in importance compared to the other specifications listed.
46,22,Black or African-American,No,Male,Precision in choice. I looked at specific features
47,60,White,No,Female,I chose the item with the highest number of what was important to me.  IE screen size
48,28,White,No,Female,"under microwave i wa s choosing the best with cooking power ,in laptop i was choosing based on speed , in washing machine i was choosing based on energy saving and on tv i was  choosing based on warrant"
49,51,White,No,Female,"I chose the products that either had more processing speed, energy savings, cooking time, or bigger screens."
50,57,White,No,Male,strength in numbers

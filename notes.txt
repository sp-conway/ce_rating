modeled stimuli off of Banerjee et al, exp 5
where the decoys value = 25

USED JSPSYCH 7.3 FOR BOTH EXPS
Added back in attraction trials, both binary and trinary, to choice only experiment

Now there are both attraction and repulsion trials, both binary and trinary
No longer using the TD distance manipulation.

I labeled the repulsion trials:
    - target_high (the dimension the target is highest on)
      - doesn't apply to attraction binary because target / comp label is arbitrary
      - repulsion binary target/comp label is also arbitrary, but need to account for taking up separate regions of space
    - A/B. 
      - A if the target is the more extreme option (as in the rating experiment), B if the target is the more intermediate option (NEW).
There are now 44 total trials. 8 catch, 36 critical
  - 4 catch trinary
  - 4 catch binary
  - 4 attraction binary
    - 1 per product category
  - 8 repulsion binary
    - 1 each per product category, t_high value
  - 16 repulsion trinary
    - 1 each per product category, t_high value, A/B label
  - 8 attraction trinary
    - 1 each per product category, t_high value

bayes_price_2: just updated priors on covariance matrices so eta = .5 (i.e., less density around identity)

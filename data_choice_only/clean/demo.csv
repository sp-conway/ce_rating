47,20,Asian,No,Female,I chose to have a balance between both,434730,I'm not sure
48,24,Asian,No,Male,I chose daily appliances for their reliability and the devices in terms of fairly spread out performance,427331.599999964,No
49,19,Asian,No,Male,"Whenever I was asked to pick between the higher vs lower warranty, I normally pick the lower one because the performance is better, I don't normally anticipate using the warranty at all.",474680.300000191,I'm not sure
1,18,White,No,Male,I tried to get as close to the same number for both sides. So there wasn't one side that was suffering significantly more than the other,429157,NA
2,19,White,No,Male,I chose the greatest total number and wouldn't pick any that were like 100-20 I'd go for 80-40,347813.699999988,No
3,19,White,No,Female,"I chose to go with whatever category matched each other best, because when one is deficient, the other is strong, but together if they are about equal it would be best, in my mind.",999937.700000048,No
4,19,White,No,Male,I wanted to find the right balance between the 2 things being desrcibed so I was getting the best possible product each time.,399507.900000572,No
5,19,White,No,Male,I wanted the most efficient product of both categories,554671,No
6,18,White,No,Male,I would look at the two numbers and add them together to see which selections were the highest. If two selections were the same sum I would look at which one is more evenly distributed.,694930.599999905,No
7,20,White,No,Female,I ranked categories on what was most important to me and decided using that,199500.299999982,No
8,20,White,No,Male,I decided what was more important in certain products. Washing machines and televisions should last long and buying new ones are a hassle and not something you want to do often. I think people generally care more about a computers speed than memory. I think cooking power is more important in microwaves and people rarely exercise the warranty.,522343,I'm not sure
9,21,Other,No,Male,"I value functionality over lifespan in products, but lifespan is importatn so i would find the middle groun between the two",261817,I'm not sure

11,21,Asian,No,Female,"In my opinion, average life span would be more prioritized. This is why I tried to make my decisions based on the best option for average life span. .",533336.800000001,No
12,21,White,No,Female,"I selected my answers based on the quality of the product. The products were things consumers typically have for 5+ years, so they are going to want the best thing for the quality of the produc",521864.900000006,No
13,20,Asian,No,Female,"I would make a decision about which category was more important to me and based on that, that category would have to have a higher score",870397.200000003,No

16,21,White,No,Female,I picked a few things that I thought were the most importantly and went off of the ratings for those categories,307879,No

19,19,Other,Yes,Female,Whatever felt more logically useful on both categories or if one category is more of a necessity than the other for the object then I would choose whichever number is higher for it.,804270.399999857,No
20,21,White,No,Female,"I like to choose the one that has less of a difference between the two categories, and am not particularly drawn to one category or another so whichever i can get the best of both worlds is what I've been choosing.",444626.800000012,Yes
21,22,White,No,Male,I just clicked what I felt was best,173028.800000012,No
23,19,"Black or African-American,White",No,Female,I prioritized the life-span of the product and it's function.,683039,No
24,18,Asian,No,Female,"I tried to weigh what would be important to me with each factor. If there were some equal numbers such as lifespan at 90, 100, and 100, while the screen size was 40, 30, and 20 respectively, I decided to choose the one with the closest to average by sacrificing the other higher catergories.",789419,No
25,NA,White,No,Male,"I tried to choose the ones that were most evenly atributed to each category. If one said 100 and the other side said 30, I would choose the 90 and 40 instead.",830330,Yes
26,20,White,No,Female,"i chose what seemed to be the happy medium, except for the washing machine where I chose the best energy savings for the environment",527906.400000006,No
27,19,Asian,No,Male,"Some qualities are dealbreakers for me. For example, I will always prioritize TV screen size over warranty since I think I gain way more utility from a larger screen relative to having to spend more. I also took into account the marginal increase/decrease in score, noting that 100->90 is a 10% decrease while 40->30 is a 25% decrease. I can sacrifice 10% processing speed to gain 33% RAM since both are necessary for a good computer, but as a programmer I prefer RAM to processing speed if it's a 1 to 1 exchange.",637945.900000006,No

30,18,White,Yes,Female,I chose based off of which option was more important in my opinion and than picked the one that had higher in that.,NA,No
31,19,White,No,Male,My biggest strategy was picking the machines with the longest life spans. Other than that I choose the option with the best of both worlds.,590398,No

39,19,White,No,Female,"certain things mattered more to me for example I would prefer to have a fast working computer, a long lasting washing machine, and I don't really care much about the size of my TV. I also tried to think realistically about things that have to be replaced more often. Besides that I mostly chose the options that were higher on both sides of the table.  I also realized that it seemed like the diferrence between 40 and 30 would have a bigger effect on the product than 90 and 100 for some reason.",839346,No

44,19,Asian,No,Female,"I tried to pick the products with the highest numbers all around, but when there were much lower numbers for one aspect of the product (usually below 50) and the higher numbers were 90 instead of 100 for example, I chose products with 90 instead of 100 because 90 is still fairly close to 100, meaning any product with that number is still very good. I would rather have a product with higher numbers overall than a product with one very high number and one very low one.",1008897,No
